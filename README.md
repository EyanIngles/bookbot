# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

This is to show my scripting abilities utilising python as the main language to solve problems I was given.
There are 3 short books that are inside the directory of `books` which can be called by running the following code in the terminal;
`python3 main.py ./books/<book_file_name_here>` 
There is some minor error handling to which will direct you in saying that the pathway exists or too many args or not enough to run the script.
